Selenium Page Object Model (POM)

1. What is POM?
- It is the process where we create a class for each page of the application
- This page contains the elements locators for that page and action methods.
- URL = https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com

2. Why to use POM?
- POM stands for PAge Object Model.
- Page Object Model refers to the objects of the web page (section) that out tests is interacting with
- In POM we create separate class for storing all objects and the actions to be taken on that objects
- Locators and methods are kept separate from the test scripts.
- This helps in
    - Maintenance
    - Less rework
    - Better & Understandable code
    - In Case of changes , fix needs to be done at one place only
    - Avoids duplication code
    - Stable and Reusable

4. Practical Hands-On

To run test successfully from CMD terminal we have to import these below before class imports
import sys
import os
sys.path.append(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__),"..",".."))

if still module not found error occurs go to the dir one above the Module
and Run it as similar hierarchy below it will work.
python -m Demo.POM.Tests.LoginTest
